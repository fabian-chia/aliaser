This is a script written in /bin/sh it fully automates the adding of alias into the the resource file so that you don't have to worry

INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW
- what you want to call your alias (if you forget the name of your alias just enter 'alias' into the terminal to show you all the alias in your machine)
- the full file path of the script that you want to add as an alias(will make things a lot smoother)
- it would be good to restart your terminal again after the script has ran
